### Official rules & contest site

### Example entry scripts
See [precise/examples_m6](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/blob/main/examples_m6)

    from precise.skatertools.m6.competition import m6_competition_entry
    df = m6_competition_entry()

This will choose from a hundred different ways of generating cov, and from a dozen different portfolio construction methods. Or you can specify. 

### Example entry csv's
See [precise/examples_m6/full](https://github.com/microprediction/precise/tree/main/examples_m6/full) for example .csv's to modify as you see fit. 



### Analytical tools for 5-way rank probabilities 
(no longer relevant, sorry)
- Paper soon. See [notebook examples](https://github.com/microprediction/m6/tree/main/notebook_examples) 

### Python time-series packages 
See also [PYTHON_PACKAGES.md](https://github.com/microprediction/m6/blob/main/PYTHON_PACKAGES.md)

- [Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/overall.html) of autonomous time-series prediction algorithms judged against live data. 
- [Listing](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/popular-timeseries-packages) of popular Python time-series packages, including features, causality and so forth.

### Practice data 
(PR's welcome)

Much more once the portfolios are announced. Stay tuned for [live streams](https://www.microprediction.org/browse_streams.html) and predictions of the same, if you suspect that short-horizon co-dependencies and volatilities might somehow relate to longer horizons.
